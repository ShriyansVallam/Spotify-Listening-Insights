# Spotify-Listening-Insights

## **Project Background**

This project aims to analyze my personal Spotify usage and create a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to showcase listening habits, preferences and trends. The goal is to provide an interactive, visual representation of various aspects of Spotify data, such as top tracks, top artists, listening history, genres, and other metrics that reveal insights about music preferences over time.

## **Dataset**

The data for this project was obtained using Spotify's API, which I used to extract my own personal listening history from the past 6 months. 

## **General Insights**
Below is the overview page from the Power BI dashboard and can be accessed here: https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/3eca1c75-bad0-40a9-9907-d553e75f4c5e/73cb8dd6b6153e4c204c?experience=power-bi

* Over the past 6 months I have listened to 66 unqiue genres, with a majority of genres stemming from rap as well as eletronics
* Travis Scott and Future were my most popular artists
* The combination of a high energy score (0.72) and high danceability (0.62) indicates that I tend to enjoy energetic genres like hip-hop, electronic dance music (EDM), or pop
* The average valence of 0.42 suggests I lean towards genres that might carry a slightly darker or more contemplative mood.
